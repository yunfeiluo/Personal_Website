Dependencies: Python3 with package gzip and numpy.
1) download Python3 at "https://www.python.org/downloads/"
2) json and gzip is built-in package. 

Building the code: 
The code with suffix ".py" is runnable, and in this project, the main driver is "run.py". 

Running the code: 
1) extract the zip file
2) run the code by typing: python -m src.run
3) the program will read and parse the input file, then initialize a "inverted index" object and build the indeces.
4) the program will then iterate over the queries, and compute scores for each documents based on BM25 and QL back-to-back.
